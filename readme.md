# GoBoy
The GoBoy is a fantasy console(kind of?) written in Go, using Raylib


It runs cartridges(like PICO-8 and TIC-80), but instead of using an imbedded language like Lua or MoonScript, it's written in 100% Go(because heck no I'm not going through the trouble to use an imbedded language)

If the above page looks unfinished, NO YOU'RE UNFINISHED!(but in all seriousness that just means I'm still working on it so just give it a bit)
